<h2> Police Training in Pittsburgh </h2>
  <h1> By: Noah Hubbard </h1>
  <p> In 2013, following acquittal of George Zimmerman for the death of Trayvon Martin, a movement called Black Lives Matter was born. By 2014, issues of police violence, and other systemic inequalities related to the justice system in the United States became apart of the national discussion in ways not seen before. In this same time period, the Pittsburgh Police Department saw major changes in how they spent their time training officers. 
  </p>
  
  <p> From 2013 to 2014, several training categories associated with lowering levels of police violence saw a significant increase in how many hours were devoted to them. Mental health training saw an increase from 2,710 hours of training to 5,775 hours. According to study of police shootings from 1980 to 2008, at least half of all police shooting victims have mental health issues, making this an extremely important topic. Additionally, an entirely new category of training was created in 2014 dedicated to training Pittsburgh Police officers in procedural ethics. In tandem with this increased training, in 2015 the Pittsburgh police department adopted a series of policy changes associated with lowering police violence. These policies included banning chokeholds, requring de-escalation tactics, requiring officers to warn suspects before they shoot, and clearly stating what types of force is appropriate in their official policy.
    
    <p> While increased training, and policy changes is one thing, what is most important is whether this training is having the desired effect of reducing deaths at the hands of police officers. It's extremely difficult to find exhaustive data on police shootings, and even harder to determine whether these shootings were justified. However, there has not been a high-profile police shooting in Pittsburgh since 2012 when Leon Ford Jr was unjustly shot and subsequently paralyzed by the Pittsburgh police. In 2018, unarmed teenager Antwon Rose was shot and killed by the East Pittsburgh police, a separate municipality with a seperate police department. Studies have shown that having small municipalities, such as East Pittsburgh, have their own police department is detrimental to community safety, and that suburban municipalities account for a disproportionate share of police shootings. 
  </p>
  
  <p> In 2019, police violence continues to be a major issue in the United States, which begs the question, what can the city of Pittsburgh, and the surrounding area do to create a safer community? At the local level, the city of Pittsburgh can continue their trend of increased training of their officers. As the chart below shows, since the shooting of Leon Ford Jr, and the visibility of the Black Lives Matter movement, police training has trended in the right direction in Pittsburgh. In addition to the policies they have already adopted, the Pittsburgh police should consider other policies associated with decreased police violence such as, the duty to intervene when witnessing a fellow officer using excessive force, restricting shooting at moving vehicles, and requiring that officers exhaust all other options before resorting to deadly force. At the county level, Allegheny county should consider taking over policing for all of the suburban municipalities of Pittsburgh which would reduce the risk involved with small municipality policing.
